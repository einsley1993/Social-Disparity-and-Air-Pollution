Project: Using Mediational G Formula to Estimate the Effect of Social Disparity on All-cause Mortality through Air Pollution across Six Cycles of the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort

sim1.R is the code for a preliminary simualation datset.

mg.R is the code for mediational G formula.

The mediational G formula code is based on the following references:

Acknowledgement: I would like to thank Dr. Tarik Benmarhnia for the discussion on implemeting the mediation G formula in R. The R script he shared earlier in personal conversation with me was a good starting point for the development of the code in this repo.
